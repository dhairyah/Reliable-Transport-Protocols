# Reliable-Transport-Protocols
Simulated implementation of three reliable data transport protocols: Alternating-Bit (ABT), Go-Back-N (GBN), and Selective-Repeat (SR).

Program contains sending and receiving transport-layer code for implementing the the reliable data transfer protocols. The program was executed in a simulated hardware/software environment and the performance analysis was performed.
